          <h3>Vue.js weather app</h3>
          <p>In this project, my goal was to create a weather forecasting app using the OpenWeather API and present the
            data in an easy-to-use interface.</p>

          <h3>Lokaler.lnu.no</h3>
          <p>This project was introduced to me at a programming course with the creators, where they taught me the basic
            concepts of Ruby on Rails and how to create components. I was also shown how to send pull requests to the
            repository and work on my code based on their feedback. I am still listed as a contributor on this project,
            although I mostly just observe the website's development.</p>

          <h3>Webshop</h3>
          <p>I created this project as practice for building functional websites using the Flask library in Python to
            serve templates and data to the site. It started as a basic webshop template, but I expanded its
            functionality and essentially rewrote the code from scratch.</p>

          <h3>Elevation-API</h3>
          <p>This project aimed to be an app that could return the height of the ground (above sea level) at a given set
            of latitude and longitude coordinates. I spent most of the project figuring out how to retrieve this
            information, and I eventually discovered a black and white height map. I then focused on how to extract data
            from the map and into an array, which I was able to accomplish to some extent.</p>
